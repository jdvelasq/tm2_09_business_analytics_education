CONTEXT:
I am writing a literature review paper based on the dominant thematic clusters in BUSINESS ANALYTICS EDICATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. 


GOAL:
Give me suggestions of cluster names based on the provided list of names presented below and the cluster description.


CLUSTER DESCRIPTION:
The first thematic cluster focuses on curriculum design and skills development in business schools, emphasizing the alignment of educational programs with evolving industry needs. Business schools play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and market demands by fostering competencies in areas such as data analytics, decision-making, and quantitative analysis [85, 95, 48]. Institutions increasingly integrate experiential learning and innovative pedagogies, such as case-based and gamified approaches, to enhance student engagement and practical decision-making skills [91, 101, 102]. Despite this progress, gaps remain, particularly in addressing emerging technological demands and core areas like data quality [20, 71]. There is no standardized model curriculum, which creates inconsistencies in graduate skills and complicates employer expectations [66]. To maintain competitive advantage, educational institutions must continuously refine curricula by integrating interdisciplinary approaches, partnerships with external organizations, and adaptive educational models [17, 30, 41]. These reforms are necessary to prepare graduates for the data-driven business landscape, ensuring they possess the practical knowledge and technological competencies, including analytics and AI, required for success in modern industries [26, 53, 36].
