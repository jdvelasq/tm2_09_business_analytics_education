PAPER TITLE:
Trends in Business Analytics Education: Innovation, Learning, and Pedagogy


PAPER ABSTRACT:
This comprehensive literature review explores the dynamic evolution of business analytics education, focusing on curriculum innovation, experiential learning, and emerging pedagogical strategies. Analyzing 103 scholarly articles from 2012 to 2014, the study identifies three core themes: Curriculum Innovation for Industry Competencies, Experiential Learning in Analytical Decision-Making, and Innovative Pedagogies for Skill Development. These themes are further examined through nine critical dimensions: Curriculum Design, Analytical Skills Development, Industry Collaboration, and Technology-Enhanced Learning. The review underscores the growing importance of aligning curricula with industry demands, integrating data literacy and ethical considerations, and leveraging technology to improve learning outcomes. Challenges such as the academic-industry gap and the need for ongoing faculty development are also discussed. This review synthesizes current trends in business analytics education. It offers insights for future curriculum innovation and industry collaboration, emphasizing the necessity of equipping graduates with essential competencies for the modern workforce.

JUSTIFICATION:
To the best of the authors' knowledge, literature reviews on this topic have yet to be published. The unique document classified as a review is the work of Zhang [12], where business visual analytics is introduced. A literature review on BA education is crucial, given the need for comprehensive analyses that address the pedagogical advancements and curricular innovations in this rapidly evolving field. As BA continues to become integral to industry practices, examining how educational institutions adapt to equip students with the necessary skills and competencies is essential. This review is critical in filling the gap by synthesizing existing research and identifying key trends and challenges, providing a foundation for future curriculum development and fostering more effective industry-academic collaboration. Without such a review, educators and institutions may lack the insights needed to evolve their programs in alignment with industry demands and the evolving landscape of BA.

PAPER OBJECTIVES:
This article critically analyzes current trends in BA education and skills development, proposes future research directions, and discusses prevailing challenges. To achieve this, the study employs a methodology grounded in co-word analysis and tech-mining techniques to identify dominant themes within the literature. These themes highlight significant trends in BA education and student skills acquisition. Subsequently, each thematic cluster is thoroughly analyzed, and the findings are synthesized into a cohesive narrative in the discussion section.
