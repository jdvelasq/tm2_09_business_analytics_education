   BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( bi ) and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) SKILL_SETS . this
   PANEL_REPORT describes the KEY_FINDINGS and BEST_PRACTICES that were
   identified , with an emphasis on what has changed since the
   BI_CONGRESS_EFFORTS in 2009 and 2010 . the ARTICLE also serves as a " call
   to action " for universities regarding the need to respond to emerging
   MARKET_NEEDS in bi / ba , including " BIG_DATA . " the IS_FIELD continues to
   be well positioned to be the leader in creating the next generation bi / ba
   workforce . to do so , we believe that is LEADERS_NEED to continuously
   refine bi / BA_CURRICULUM to keep pace with the turbulent bi / ba
   marketplace . 2014 by the association for INFORMATION_SYSTEMS .

AB BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( bi ) has been recognized as the most essential and
   VALUABLE_TECHNOLOGY for business . cios surveyed by the society for
   INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT have consistently ranked it as one of the most
   IMPORTANT_BUSINESS_APPLICATIONS for the past ten years . bi has become
   incredibly important to an organization decision_making process . there is ,
   however , uncertainty regarding whether there is enough being done to
   prepare COLLEGE_STUDENTS to enter the WORK_FORCE with adequate technical and
   ANALYTICAL_SKILLS to meet the CURRENT_NEED for BI_ANALYSTS . in this paper
   we examine whether there is a difference in the proportion of
   SCHOOLS_OFFERING either BI_COURSEWORK or BI_DEGREES in a BUSINESS_VS .
   non_business is program . the results indicate differences in the proportion
   of SCHOOLS_OFFERING_BI_COURSES and BI_DEGREES located in colleges of
   business or non_colleges of business . although the RESEARCH is exploratory
   we provide implications for the findings .

AB this PAPER_FOCUSES on a practice_inspired RESEARCH_CHALLENGE of sharing and
   co_creation of INNOVATIVE_TEACHING_PRACTICES in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) .
   as confirmed by three INTERNATIONAL_SURVEYS of educators , ba is a very
   CHALLENGING_TEACHING_DISCIPLINE , due to rapidly changing technology ,
   complex data_related challenges , and a DISCIPLINARY_BODY of KNOWLEDGE that
   is still emerging . however , one of the greatest challenges is a
   NOTABLE_ABSENCE of well_established TEACHING_PRACTICES . the paper describes
   an ACTION_DESIGN_RESEARCH_PROJECT that includes the DESIGN and
   implementation of a wiki_based COLLABORATIVE_ENVIRONMENT for sharing of
   INNOVATIVE_TEACHING_PRACTICES as well as the DESIGN of a CONCEPTUAL_LANGUAGE
   that enables these practices to be expressed in a systematic , yet
   non_prescriptive way . theoretical underpinning for this work came from the
   theory of LEARNING designs , a well_known EDUCATIONAL_TAXONOMY ( the
   so_called revised BLOOM_TAXONOMY ) , INSTRUCTIONAL_DESIGN_PATTERNS and
   KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT . the paper also identifies some opportunities for
   further applied RESEARCH enabled by this evolving knowledge_sharing
   environment . marjanovic 2014 .

AB BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( bi ) and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) software has been
   included in many INFORMATION_SYSTEMS ( is ) CURRICULA . this study surveyed
   CURRENT and PAST_UNDERGRADUATE and GRADUATE_STUDENTS to evaluate various bi
   / ba TOOLS . specifically , this study compared several SOFTWARE_TOOLS from
   two of the MAJOR_SOFTWARE_PROVIDERS in the bi / ba field . the participants
   in the study evaluated each SOFTWARE_TOOL according to three KEY_CRITERIA :
   1 ) functionality , 2 ) EASE_OF_USE , and 3 ) LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS . the
   LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS_CRITERION was used to determine which bi / ba TOOLS
   provided the most EFFECTIVE_LEARNING of bi / ba concepts in the is classroom
   . the three criteria were used to develop recommendations for including
   specific bi / ba SOFTWARE_TOOLS in the IS_CURRICULUM . based on the findings
   of the study , the authors recommend that COLLEGES_AND_UNIVERSITIES consider
   the use of the ibm_cognos suite of TOOLS as a VIABLE_MEANS for TEACHING bi /
   ba concepts in their INFORMATION_SYSTEMS_CURRICULA . the results of the
   study are relevant to any college or UNIVERSITY that currently includes ( or
