   CURRENT_LITERATURE on BUSINESS_VISUAL_ANALYTIC_TECHNOLOGIES ( vats ) , both
   in the BUSINESS_COMMUNITY and in BUSINESS_LEARNING , and points out
   consideration as a RESEARCH_GAP in the existing literature . we conduct a
   SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW with DATABASE_SEARCHES from 2006 to 2020 . the objectives
   of the review are to identify ( a ) . the existing terminologies related to
   vats in the literature . ( b ) . the purpose of VAT_APPLICATION and the
   benefits of vats in the BUSINESS_COMMUNITY . and to examine ( c ) . how the
   vats are related to the EDUCATIONAL_CONTEXT , particularly , in
   BUSINESS_LEARNING . the findings indicate that vats provide
   POSITIVE_ENHANCEMENT in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . however , the effect of
   VAT_APPLICATION in BUSINESS_LEARNING is rather limited . we provide insights
   for further studies involving vat_enhanced BUSINESS_LEARNING . 2022
