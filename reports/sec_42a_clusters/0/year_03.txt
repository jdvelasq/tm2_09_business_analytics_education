AB recently , accounting academics have reported increased attention in the
   accounting profession toward the EMPLOYMENT of VARIOUS_TECHNOLOGIES . these
   studies ONLY_HIGHLIGHT the exploitation of these technologies in the
   profession and areas for FUTURE_RESEARCH , while missing the need for
   modernizing the accounting CURRICULUM to meet the
   INDUSTRY_TECHNOLOGICAL_NEEDS . this paper follows an integrated MODEL for
   CURRICULUM_REDESIGN to REFLECT_BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY ,
   BUSINESS_DATA_ANALYTICS , and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_EMPLOYMENT in the
   accounting profession . by building on the main four
   EDUCATIONAL_CURRICULA_DESIGNS_COMPONENTS , we propose ways to incorporate
   these technologies into the accounting CURRICULUM .
   CURRENT_INDUSTRY_IMPLEMENTATION of NEW_TECHNOLOGIES should be considered by
   academia when designing accounting CURRICULUM to prepare graduates for the
   market and to ensure their employability . this PAPER_CALLS for
   RADICAL_CHANGES in the accounting CURRICULUM to reach a balance between
   existing accounting KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_SKILLS_RELEVANT to

   changed how COMPANIES_CONDUCT their business . an increasing number of firms
   have started putting their efforts in extracting information from their

   universities across the globe are increasingly responding to this newly
   emerged field by offering both undergraduate and GRADUATE_LEVEL_DEGREES as
   well as CERTIFICATE_PROGRAMS . thus , this RESEARCH_AIMS to provide a
   FRAMEWORK for ACADEMIC_INSTITUTIONS to develop a state_of_the_art master in
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( msba ) CURRICULUM by identifying concepts , SKILLS ,
   KNOWLEDGE , and TOOLS ( cskt ) that industry seeks in BA_PRACTITIONERS . our

AB although existing DATA_SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL_PROGRAMMES develop talent and
