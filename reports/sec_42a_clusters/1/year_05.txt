   EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING such as apprenticeships , internships ,
   COOPERATIVE_EDUCATION , practicums , SERVICE_LEARNING , job shadowing ,
   fellowships and COMMUNITY_ACTIVITIES . however , very little has been done
   in systematically trying to integrate EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING to the
   MAIN_STREAM ACADEMIC_CURRICULUM . over the last two years , at the
   AUTHORS_UNIVERSITY , a NEW_PROGRAM titled uni_x was launched to achieve this
   . combining ACADEMIC_CURRICULUM with EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING_PEDAGOGY ,
   provides a CHALLENGING_ENVIRONMENT for STUDENTS to use their
   DISCIPLINARY_KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS to tackle REAL_WORLD_PROBLEMS and issues
   through inter_disciplinary approaches and activities . a course designated
   as uni_x involves external partners from corporate , non_profit or
   government_sector organisations . the course requires the STUDENT to learn
   KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS during the CLASSROOM_SESSIONS and then to apply them in
   solving a real_world project proposed by the partners . the instructor along
   with the INDUSTRY_PARTNER_PLAYS an ACTIVE_ROLE in the PROJECT_DESIGN ,
   mentoring and ASSESSMENT . in this PAPER_CONTRIBUTION , the authors share
   their experience in designing a DATA_WAREHOUSING and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS (

   describes in detail the content , PEDAGOGY , in_course project , challenges
   and lessons learned when introducing EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING into an existing

AB it has been known for a fact that businesses are currently seeking ways to
   gain a COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE over its competitors . majority of these
   organizations started analysing their HISTORICAL_DATA to find valuable and
   ACTIONABLE_INSIGHTS to better serve their customers . this leads to the
   concept of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) . however , ba has not been fully
   appreciated in the philippines . furthermore , there is a shortage of
   BA_SERVICE_PROFESSIONALS . to address these issues , an
   UNDERGRADUATE_SPECIALIZATION_FRAMEWORK is proposed for STUDENTS who want to
   specialize in ba . hence , PHILIPPINE_COLLEGES and universities are now
   scrambling to offer courses of ba to supply the growing need of
   BA_PROFESSIONALS in the philippines . however , several roadblocks and
   challenges have arose . firstly , COLLEGE_INSTRUCTORS are currently
   ill_equipped to fully teach all concepts of ba . secondly , the BA_FRAMEWORK
   is designed such that the concepts are not spread out evenly on all subjects
   which leads to some concept HEAVY_COURSES while some are LIGHT_COURSES .
   thirdly , this FRAMEWORK is recommended as a specialization to two bachelor
   of SCIENCE_PROGRAMS specifically INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY ( it ) and
   BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATION ( ba ) . based on the contents of the FRAMEWORK ,
   POTENTIAL_STUDENTS taking BA_COURSES would not have the PREREQUISITE_TOPICS
   and concepts to fully appreciate and understand ba . based on this premise ,
   this paper seeks to discuss the proposed recommendations on addressing these
   issues specifically : ( 1 ) an introduction of STANDARD_SYLLABI for each
   BA_COURSE , ( 2 ) requirement of ADDITIONAL_PREREQUISITE_COURSES and ( 3 )
