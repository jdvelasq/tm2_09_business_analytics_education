AB BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( bi ) and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) software has been
   included in many INFORMATION_SYSTEMS ( is ) CURRICULA . this study surveyed
   CURRENT and PAST_UNDERGRADUATE and GRADUATE_STUDENTS to evaluate various bi
   / ba TOOLS . specifically , this study compared several SOFTWARE_TOOLS from
   two of the MAJOR_SOFTWARE_PROVIDERS in the bi / ba field . the participants
   in the study evaluated each SOFTWARE_TOOL according to three KEY_CRITERIA :
   1 ) functionality , 2 ) EASE_OF_USE , and 3 ) LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS . the
   LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS_CRITERION was used to determine which bi / ba TOOLS
   provided the most EFFECTIVE_LEARNING of bi / ba concepts in the is classroom
   . the three criteria were used to develop recommendations for including
   specific bi / ba SOFTWARE_TOOLS in the IS_CURRICULUM . based on the findings
   of the study , the authors recommend that COLLEGES_AND_UNIVERSITIES consider
   the use of the ibm_cognos suite of TOOLS as a VIABLE_MEANS for TEACHING bi /
   ba concepts in their INFORMATION_SYSTEMS_CURRICULA . the results of the
   study are relevant to any college or UNIVERSITY that currently includes ( or
   is considering the inclusion of ) BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE / BUSINESS_ANALYTICS
   concepts in its INFORMATION_SYSTEMS_CURRICULUM . 2014 edsig ( EDUCATION

AB it is essential to prepare STUDENTS with KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS in area of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) which will help business to PROCESS_DATA , find
   patterns and relations , develop insights from PAST_TRANSACTIONS , and make
   prediction . we develop hands_on labs to teach BUSINESS_ANALYTICS to
   STUDENTS in COMPUTER_SCIENCE , INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY , and
   SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINES . our hands_on labs can be adopted in
   courses such as DATABASE_SYSTEMS , DATA_WAREHOUSING , DATA_MINING , etc . we
   use ENTERPRISE_BA_TOOLS including MS_SQL_SERVER_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE and
   cognos 10 platforms , which are essential to increase STUDENT_INTERESTS ,
   improve STUDENT_LEARNING , and ENHANCE_STUDENT_CONFIDENCE . our hands_on
   labs contain three parts with one is built upon another : 1 )
   DATA_INTEGRATION . 2 ) DATA_WAREHOUSE . and 3 ) BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . 2013

   addressing the following practice_inspired , teaching_related
   RESEARCH_QUESTION : " how to DESIGN_LEARNING_ACTIVITIES to " scaffold "
   STUDENT_LEARNING in BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ) towards
   more advanced cognitive and KNOWLEDGE_DIMENSIONS , and along the way help
   STUDENTS to further develop their meta_cognitive SKILLS of LEARNING how to
   learn ? the PAPER_ADOPTS the revised BLOOM_TAXONOMY as a
   THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK and demonstrates its use in DESIGN and implementation
   of bi_related LEARNING_ACTIVITIES at DIFFERENT_LEVELS of cognitive and
   KNOWLEDGE_DIMENSIONS . the paper also offers some RESEARCH_CONTRIBUTIONS
   related to the FRAMEWORK itself , in particular perceived correlation of
   DIFFERENT_LEVELS of COGNITIVE_PROCESS and KNOWLEDGE_DIMENSIONS , not
