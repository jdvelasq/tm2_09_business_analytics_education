ROLE:
You are an automated scientific writer assistant. 


CONTEXT:
I am writing a literature review paper based on the dominant thematic clusters on BUSINESS ANALYTICS EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. You must prepare a critical review formulating a position or an opinion about the FIRST thematic cluster based on the provided abstracts. The opinion describes the relationships among the keywords and stablish a critical position about the cluster. In the critical review has three paaragraphs: TRENS, CHALLENGES, and FUTURE DIRECTIONS.


GOAL:
Your goal is write the list of TOPICS for the critical review. The TOPICS do NOT include the name of the technique or methodology. The list of TOPICS correspond to a well-known topics of interest for the target journal.


TARGET JOURNAL:
IEEE-RITA covers technological applications and research in education including design and research in new learning tools that focus on teaching and learning. The scope includes learning applications, methods, materials and new experiences as they relate to engineering learning. The journal maintains a consistent focus on the IEEE environment inside Electrical Engineering, Electronic Technology, Telecommunications and Computer Science. Main areas include technological applications and research in Education covering the design and research in new learning tools, techniques and materials that focus on teaching and learning as well as learning applications, methods and materials and new experiences of engineering learning, always focusing on the teaching/learning of the IEEE fields inside Electrical Engineering, Electronic Technology, Telecommunications and Computer Science and Engineering.

KEYWORDS DEFINING THE CLUSTER:
Students; Courses; Experiential Learning; Decision Making; Learning; Student Learning; Student Engagement; Insights; Learning Outcomes; Analytics Professionals


CLUSTER NAME:
Experimental Learning in Analytical Decision-Making


CLUSTER DEFINITION:
The second thematic cluster consistently highlights the integration of experiential learning as a critical strategy for enhancing student engagement, decision-making skills, and learning outcomes in business analytics education. Across the provided paragraphs, experiential learning is emphasized as a means of bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, with methods such as real-world case studies, project-based learning, and hands-on labs playing a central role [91][63][92]. These approaches, including flipped classrooms and scaffolded activities, are designed to mitigate students' apprehensions about complex quantitative subjects while promoting deeper cognitive engagement and mastery of analytical skills [8][101]. Furthermore, the involvement of industry partners and interdisciplinary contexts in these experiential strategies enables students to apply classroom learning to real-world challenges, thereby enhancing their readiness for professional roles as analytics professionals [17][50]. This cluster underscores the importance of active, applied learning experiences in preparing students for the complexities of real-world analytics tasks, making experiential learning a cornerstone of modern business analytics education [30][103]. Through these immersive methods, students not only gain technical expertise but also develop the critical decision-making abilities necessary to thrive in todayâ€™s competitive, data-driven business environment [24][36][39][52].
