AB BUSINESS_ANALYTICS is . researchers have made many calls to
   ENHANCE_BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_TRAINING in BUSINESS_SCHOOLS to meet the growing
   MARKET_DEMAND for ANALYTICSSAVVY_EMPLOYEES . a growing set of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_COURSES have begun to address these calls . we examine
   the maturity of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_OFFERINGS in BUSINESS_SCHOOLS in the
   UNITED_STATES by analyzing CURRENT_BUSINESS analytics_related
   COURSE_OFFERINGS of the top 104 BUSINESS_SCHOOLS . we analyze these data by
   examining the types of courses offered and rank the schools based on their
   MATURITY_LEVELS in terms of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_OFFERINGS . LONG_WAY to go
   before they reach higher levels of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_MATURITY and that they
   are not yet in an IDEAL_POSITION to serve the presumed INDUSTRY_NEEDS
