CURRENT TITLE:
Trends in Business Analytics Education and Skill Development


CURENT ABSTRACT: 
This literature review critically examines the evolving landscape of business analytics education and skills development, focusing on articles published between 2012 and 2014. A total of 103 scholarly articles were analyzed, revealing three primary thematic clusters: Curriculum Innovation for Industry Competencies, Experimental Learning in Analytical Decision-Making, and Innovative Pedagogies and Curriculum Development. These clusters were further dissected using nine key dimensions: Curriculum Design and Development, Analytical Skills Development, Experiential Learning Approaches, Industry Collaboration, Student Engagement and Outcomes, Faculty and Professional Development, Innovative Teaching Methods, Data Literacy and Ethics, and Technology-Enhanced Learning. The analysis highlights the growing demand for curricula that align with industry needs, emphasizing the importance of experiential learning and innovative teaching methods in fostering analytical decision-making skills. The review identifies significant trends, including the integration of data literacy and ethical considerations into business analytics programs, and the increasing role of technology in enhancing learning outcomes. Additionally, challenges such as the gap between academic offerings and industry expectations, and the need for ongoing faculty and professional development, are discussed. This review not only synthesizes the current state of business analytics education but also provides insights into future directions, suggesting pathways for curriculum innovation and enhanced industry collaboration. The findings underscore the necessity of aligning educational practices with the dynamic demands of the business analytics field to ensure the development of graduates equipped with the competencies required in the modern workforce.

AB BIG_DATA and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS are TRENDS that are positively impacting the
   BUSINESS_WORLD . PAST_RESEARCHES show that DATA generated in the
   MODERN_WORLD is huge and growing exponentially . these include structured
   and UNSTRUCTURED_DATA that FLOOD_ORGANIZATIONS daily . unstructured
   DATA_CONSTITUTE the majority of the WORLD_DIGITAL_DATA and these include
   TEXT_FILES , web , and SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS , emails , images , audio , movies
   , etc . the UNSTRUCTURED_DATA cannot be managed in the
   TRADITIONAL_RELATIONAL_DATABASE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM ( rdbms ) . therefore ,
   DATA_PROLIFERATION requires a rethinking of TECHNIQUES for capturing ,
   storing , and processing the DATA . this is the role BIG_DATA has come to
   play . this paper , therefore , is aimed at increasing the attention of
   ORGANIZATIONS and researchers to VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS and benefits of
   BIG_DATA_TECHNOLOGY . the PAPER_REVIEWS and discusses , the RECENT_TRENDS ,
   opportunities and pitfalls of BIG_DATA and how it has enabled ORGANIZATIONS
   to create SUCCESSFUL_BUSINESS_STRATEGIES and remain competitive , based on
   AVAILABLE_LITERATURE . furthermore , the REVIEW presents the
   VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS of BIG_DATA and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS , DATA_SOURCES
   generated in these APPLICATIONS and their KEY_CHARACTERISTICS . finally ,
   the REVIEW not only outlines the CHALLENGES for SUCCESSFUL_IMPLEMENTATION of
   BIG_DATA_PROJECTS but also highlights the CURRENT_OPEN_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS
   of BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS that require further consideration . the reviewed
   areas of BIG_DATA suggest that GOOD_MANAGEMENT and manipulation of the

AB PURPOSE : the PURPOSE of this paper is to explore the role of STORYTELLING
   in DATA_INTERPRETATION , decision_making and individual_level ADOPTION of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( BA ) . DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / approach : existing
   theory is extended by introducing the concept of BA data_driven STORYTELLING
   and by synthesizing INSIGHTS from BA , STORYTELLING , BEHAVIORAL_RESEARCH ,
   LINGUISTICS , psychology and neuroscience . using theory_building
   METHODOLOGY , a MODEL with propositions is introduced to demonstrate the
   RELATIONSHIP between STORYTELLING , DATA_INTERPRETATION_QUALITY ,
   decision_making quality , INTENTION_TO_USE BA and ACTUAL_BA_USE . FINDINGS :
   BA data_driven STORYTELLING is a narrative SENSEMAKING heuristic positively
   influencing HUMAN_BEHAVIOR towards BA_USE . ORGANIZATIONS deliberately
   disseminating BA data_driven stories can improve the quality of
   INDIVIDUAL_DATA_INTERPRETATION and decision_making , resulting in increased
   INDIVIDUAL_UTILIZATION of BA on a DAILY_BASIS . RESEARCH_LIMITATIONS /
   implications : to acquire a deeper understanding of BA data_driven
   STORYTELLING in BEHAVIORAL_OPERATIONAL_RESEARCH ( bor ) , FUTURE_STUDIES
   should test the THEORETICAL_MODEL of this study and focus on exploring the
   complexity and diversity in INDIVIDUAL_ATTITUDES toward BA .
   PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS : this study provides PRACTICAL_GUIDANCE for
   BUSINESS_PRACTITIONERS who struggle with interpreting VAST_AMOUNTS of
   COMPLEX_DATA , making data_driven decisions and incorporating BA into
   DAILY_OPERATIONS . originality / VALUE : this cross_disciplinary study
   develops existing bor , STORYTELLING and BA_LITERATURE by showing how a
   novel BA data_driven STORYTELLING approach can FACILITATE_BA_ADOPTION in

AB the idea of BIG_DATA provides practitioners in the LOGISTICS_INDUSTRY with
   VALUABLE_OPPORTUNITIES to improve their OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY and
   ECONOMIC_PERFORMANCE . in FACT , BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_TECHNIQUES are
   increasingly being used in INTERNATIONAL_LOGISTICS , shipping , and
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT . we examine the impact of BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE (
   BI ) SYSTEM_ADOPTION on FIRMS_MARKET_VALUE and the influences of the
   operating characteristics and contexts of FIRMS . specifically , we examine
   whether the impacts of BI_ADOPTION are contingent on
   INDUSTRY_COMPETITIVENESS , FIRMS OPERATING_CYCLE , and INDUSTRY_MUNIFICENCE
   . using the EVENT_STUDY_METHODOLOGY , we analyse 272 MANUFACTURING FIRMS in
   the usa that adopted BI_SYSTEMS from 2005 to 2014 . we find that BI_ADOPTION
   does not have an IMMEDIATE_IMPACT on FIRMS_STOCK_RETURNS , but SUCH_IMPACT
   is significantly enhanced for FIRMS in highly COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES , and
   those with short operating cycles and HIGH_INDUSTRY_MUNIFICENCE , i.e.,
   high_growth INDUSTRIES , suggesting that FIRMS in fast_changing
   DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENTS find BI_SYSTEMS much more useful . 2021

AB the influence of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS on SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE has become
   notable over the last decade . the PURPOSE of this study is to identify and
   analyze the effect of ENDOGENOUS_VARIABLES of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS , if any ,
   on SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE . we have conducted a
   SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW ( slr ) in four SEQUENTIAL_STAGES , that is ,
   collecting existing literature from RELEVANT_DATABASES , finding endogenous
   variable ( s ) in this context , classifying papers based on how the
   endogenous variable ( s ) under consideration affect the impact of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS on SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE and , finally , segmenting
   the literature depending on DIFFERENT_TYPES of SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE .
   the STUDY_CONSIDERS_RESEARCH_PAPERS published during the period 20082023 .
   based on the analysis of the literature , it is found that
   MARKET_COMPETITION is an IMPORTANT_ENDOGENOUS variable in this context .
   this variable can impact the RELATIONSHIP between BUSINESS_ANALYTICS and
   SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE in DIFFERENT_WAYS . it can serve as a moderating
   variable , mediating variable or main variable . in this study , we have
   shown how DIRECTIONAL_RELATIONSHIPS among BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ,
   MARKET_COMPETITION and SUPPLY_CHAIN PERFORMANCE have changed over time . the
   FUTURE_SCOPE of the proposed study could be to identify other
   ENDOGENOUS_VARIABLES at the time of verifying the influence of
