AB many higher EDUCATION_INSTITUTIONS have responded to the
   SIGNIFICANT_SHORTAGE of professionals with STRONG_ANALYTICAL_EXPERTISE by
   OFFERING_GRADUATE_PROGRAMS in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS and DATA_SCIENCE . these
   programs are typically designed to be practitioner focused and many of them
   offer a CAPSTONE_COURSE that gives STUDENTS the opportunity to conduct a
   real_world ANALYTICS_PROJECT . in this ARTICLE , we describe the
   INNOVATIVE_DESIGN of a CAPSTONE_COURSE offered to cohorts of approximately
   110 GRADUATE_STUDENTS in the BUSINESS_SCHOOL at the UNIVERSITY of texas ,
   austin . this course is designed to deliver self_directed and
   EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING from interacting with BUSINESS_STAKEHOLDERS and
   successfully completing team_based , BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_PROJECTS within a
   COMMERCIAL_FIRM using the FIRM_DATA . the COURSE_DESIGN includes STUDENT and
   SPONSOR_ENGAGEMENT , the formation of diverse balanced PROJECT_TEAMS ,
   matching of teams with projects , and SCAFFOLDING , which includes
   consistent structured mentoring , TEAM_REFLECTIONS , INTERIM_DELIVERABLES
   and in_class LEARNING for PRACTICAL_SKILLS not covered elsewhere in the
   CURRICULUM . this course has now been offered successfully to two cohorts .
   in this ARTICLE , we will also DESCRIBE_CHANGES made for the second cohort
   related to TEAM_FORMATION , project matching , mentoring and in_class

   phase with STUDENTS often lacking a COMPREHENSIVE_UNDERSTANDING of the
   ENTIRE_ANALYTICS_PROCESS including dealing with real_life data that are not
   necessarily " clean " and / or small . similarly , the emphasis on
   ANALYTICAL_RIGOR often comes at the expense of STORYTELLING , which is among
   the most IMPORTANT_ASPECTS of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . in this ARTICLE , we
   demonstrate how the philosophy of the CROSS_INDUSTRY STANDARD_PROCESS for
   DATA_MINING ( crisp_dm ) FRAMEWORK can be infused into the TEACHING of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS through a term_long project that simulates the real_world

   using REAL_DATA and the programming LANGUAGE_R for illustration . we also
   discuss the PEDAGOGICAL_THEORIES and techniques involved in the application
   of the crisp_dm FRAMEWORK . finally , we document how the crisp_dm FRAMEWORK

AB purpose : the purpose of this paper is to analyze the inadequacies of
   CURRENT_BUSINESS_EDUCATION in the tackling of the educational challenges
   inherent to the advent of a data_driven business world . it presents an
   analysis of the implications of digitization and more specifically
   BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS ( bda ) and DATA_SCIENCE ( ds ) on organizations with a
   SPECIAL_EMPHASIS on decision_making processes and the function of managers .
   it argues that BUSINESS_SCHOOLS and other EDUCATIONAL_INSTITUTIONS have well
   responded to the need to train FUTURE_DATA_SCIENTISTS but have rather
   disregarded the question of effectively preparing FUTURE_MANAGERS for the
   new data_driven business era . DESIGN / methodology / approach : the
   APPROACH_INVOLVES_ANALYSIS and review of the literature . findings : the
   development of ANALYTICS_SKILLS shall not pertain to DATA_SCIENTISTS only ,
   it must rather become an organizational CULTURAL_COMPONENT shared among all
   employees and more specifically among DECISION_MAKERS : managers . in the
   data_driven business era , managers turn into manager_scientists who shall
   possess SKILLS at the crossroad of DATA_MANAGEMENT , analytical / modeling
   techniques and TOOLS , and business . however , the MULTIDISCIPLINARY_NATURE
   of BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS and DATA_SCIENCE ( bdads ) seems to collide with the
   dominant FUNCTIONAL_SILO_DESIGN that CHARACTERIZES_BUSINESS_SCHOOLS . the
   scope and breadth of the radical digitally enabled change , the author are
   facing , may necessitate a global questioning about the nature and structure
   of BUSINESS_EDUCATION . RESEARCH limitations / implications : for the sake
   of transparency and clarity , academia and the industry must join forces to
   standardize the meaning of the terms surrounding BIG_DATA . bda / ds
   training programs , courses , and CURRICULA shall be organized in such a way
   that STUDENTS shall interact with an array of specialists providing them a
   broad enough picture of the BIG_DATA_LANDSCAPE . the
   MULTIDISCIPLINARY_NATURE of ANALYTICS and DS_NECESSITATES to
   REVISIT_PEDAGOGICAL_MODELS by developing EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING and
   implementing a spiral_shaped PEDAGOGICAL_APPROACH . the attention of
   scholars is needed as there exists an array of unexplored
   RESEARCH_TERRITORIES . this investigation will help bridge the gap between
   EDUCATION and the industry . PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS : the findings will help
   practitioners understand the educational challenges triggered by the advent
   of the data_driven business era . the implications will also help develop
   EFFECTIVE_TRAININGS and PEDAGOGICAL_STRATEGIES that are better suited to
   prepare FUTURE_PROFESSIONALS for the new data_driven business world .
   originality / VALUE : by demonstrating how the advent of a data_driven
   business era is impacting the function and role of managers , the
   PAPER_INITIATES a debate revolving around the question about how
   BUSINESS_SCHOOLS and HIGHER_EDUCATION shall evolve to better tackle the

AB it has been known for a fact that businesses are currently seeking ways to
   gain a COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE over its competitors . majority of these
   organizations started analysing their HISTORICAL_DATA to find valuable and
   ACTIONABLE_INSIGHTS to better serve their customers . this leads to the
   concept of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) . however , ba has not been fully
   appreciated in the philippines . furthermore , there is a shortage of
   BA_SERVICE_PROFESSIONALS . to address these issues , an
   UNDERGRADUATE_SPECIALIZATION_FRAMEWORK is proposed for STUDENTS who want to
   specialize in ba . hence , PHILIPPINE_COLLEGES and universities are now
   scrambling to offer courses of ba to supply the growing need of
   BA_PROFESSIONALS in the philippines . however , several roadblocks and
   challenges have arose . firstly , COLLEGE_INSTRUCTORS are currently
   ill_equipped to fully teach all concepts of ba . secondly , the BA_FRAMEWORK
   is designed such that the concepts are not spread out evenly on all subjects
   which leads to some concept HEAVY_COURSES while some are LIGHT_COURSES .
   thirdly , this FRAMEWORK is recommended as a specialization to two bachelor
   of SCIENCE_PROGRAMS specifically INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY ( it ) and
   BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATION ( ba ) . based on the contents of the FRAMEWORK ,
   POTENTIAL_STUDENTS taking BA_COURSES would not have the PREREQUISITE_TOPICS
   and concepts to fully appreciate and understand ba . based on this premise ,
   this paper seeks to discuss the proposed recommendations on addressing these
   issues specifically : ( 1 ) an introduction of STANDARD_SYLLABI for each
   BA_COURSE , ( 2 ) requirement of ADDITIONAL_PREREQUISITE_COURSES and ( 3 )

   perception that R is a better tool than excel for dmba , and ( iii ) a

   STUDENTS , analyzed using PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_ANALYSIS ( pca ) and

AB in the CURRENT_AGE of DATA_ANALYTICS , there has been a push for the
   emergence of technologies that allow for INTERACTIVE_ANALYSIS of
   EXTENSIVE_AMOUNTS of quickly produced , highly varied data . these
   technologies require people ( nicknamed " DATA_SCIENTISTS " ) from many
   BUSINESS_DISCIPLINES who are capable of managing and analyzing this data for
   use in DECISION_MAKING_PROCESSES . in order to educate and train more of
   these people , there has been an increase in the TEACHING of
   ANALYTICAL_TOOLS in both MANAGEMENT_INFORMATION_SYSTEMS ( MIS ) and
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) programs . this ARTICLE will DESCRIBE_DETAILS of
   an exercise on BUSINESS_ANALYTICS specially tailored for the introduction to
   MIS or BA_COURSE . the exercise utilizes a MARKET_BASKET_ANALYSIS for a
   CASE_SCENARIO in which point_of_sale data will be used to compare
   DIFFERENT_PRODUCTS . the goal of the exercise is to give STUDENTS hands_on
   experience with association mining , NETWORK_ANALYSIS , RECOMMENDER_SYSTEMS
   and VISUALIZATION in order to facilitate higher LEVEL_LEARNING of
   DATA_ANALYTICS . SAS_ENTERPRISE_MINER is a full_feature stand_alone

AB BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_SYSTEMS are seen by many to be a growing source of VALUE
   and COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE for businesses . however , it is not clear if
   increasingly advanced ANALYTICAL_CAPABILITIES create opportunities for
   radical change in business or just represent an INCREMENTAL_IMPROVEMENT to
   existing systems . what are the KEY_QUESTIONS that researchers should be
   focusing on to improve our understanding of ANALYTICS ? and are IS_PROGRAMS
   TEACHING STUDENTS the RIGHT_THINGS to be successful in this environment ?
   this PANEL_AIMS to take stock of TECHNOLOGICAL_POSSIBILITIES ,
   PRACTICAL_EXPERIENCE and leading RESEARCH to assess the CURRENT_STATE and
   FUTURE_DIRECTION of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . in doing so , it will bring
   together SENIOR_RESEARCHERS and INDUSTRY_REPRESENTATIVES to share the
   leading challenges , opportunities and GOOD_PRACTICE that they see .

AB BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) has become a source of COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGES for
   companies . while there is a MASSIVE_AMOUNT of data available to companies ,
   only a SMALL_PORTION of it can actually be analyzed . lack of employees with
   the RIGHT_ANALYTICAL_SKILLS is a PRIMARY_REASON for that . as the need for
   professionals with BA_SKILLS has grown , universities have launched dozens
   of BA_PROGRAMS to supply those professionals . however , there is no
   BA_MODEL_CURRICULUM for UNDERGRADUATE_PROGRAMS , which makes it difficult
   for employers to make any expectations in regard to SKILLS acquired when a
   STUDENT_GRADUATES from these programs . as such , the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this
   RESEARCH is to propose a MODEL_CURRICULUM for an UNDERGRADUATE_BA_MAJOR .

AB purpose : the purpose of this paper is to describe how BRIEF_EXERCISES in
   introductory and advanced marketing courses can help BUSINESS_STUDENTS
   achieve a BROADER_UNDERSTANDING of what BIG_DATA and DATA_ANALYTICS mean in
   the workplace . these SHORT_ANALYTICS_PROBLEMS fit into the culture that we
   are building at our institution to create ANALYTICS_CASES for courses within
   our BUSINESS_CURRICULUM . DESIGN / methodology / approach : a DATABASE of
   1,500 CUSTOMER_REVIEWS for a fictitious sporting company was created . two
   exercises based on text mining and SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS were developed to be
   tested in introductory and advanced marketing course . STUDENTS were
   introduced to the BASIC_CONCEPTS used in DATA_ANALYSIS and the creation of
   R_CODE for extracting SENTIMENT_WORDS was demonstrated . STUDENTS then used
   PIVOT_TABLES to IDENTIFY_PATTERNS in the given data set . STUDENTS in the
   INTRODUCTORY_COURSE completed a short exercise while the STUDENTS in the
   advanced class developed a detailed memo . findings : results suggest that
   STUDENTS in the INTRODUCTORY_COURSE are significantly more aware of the use
   of data in the industry as well as methods to deal with BIG_DATA after
   completing the exercise as compared to their KNOWLEDGE at the beginning of
   the exercise . STUDENTS in the advanced course are able to IDENTIFY_PATTERNS
   , detect shortcoming and propose STRATEGIC_PLANS based on their analysis of
   the data . originality / VALUE : proposed exercises in the study are
   developed with an aim to help BUSINESS_SCHOOLS develop a CULTURE_SUPPORTIVE
   of ANALYTICS . the purpose of these exercises is to make STUDENTS aware of
   the importance of BIG_DATA and ANALYTICS early on in their CURRICULUM and

AB in today data_centric world , KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS (
   ba ) have become critical for BUSINESS_PROFESSIONALS to the extent that
   FOUNDATION_BA_COURSES are increasingly being recognised globally as the
   CORE_COMPONENT of BUSINESS_PROGRAMS . however , these courses are
   characterised by LARGE_COHORTS of STUDENTS from DIVERSE_BACKGROUNDS where
   DEEP_ENGAGEMENT among STUDENTS is hard to achieve . this ARTICLE presents
   the DESIGN and implementation of threaded CASE_STUDIES premised on the
   COMMUNITY of INQUIRY_MODEL to DEEPEN_ENGAGEMENT in a FOUNDATION_BA_COURSE
   with large and DIVERSE_COHORTS of STUDENTS enrolled in online and
   HYBRID_MODES . the cases were developed with a focus on the SOCIAL_PRESENCE
   , COGNITIVE_PRESENCE , and TEACHING presence . the quantitative and
   QUALITATIVE_DATA indicated that the threaded CASE_STUDY_APPROACH not only
   increased learners pass rate and OVERALL_SATISFACTION with the course , but
   also increased enthusiasm for the course and optimised their LEARNING by
   engaging them in AUTHENTIC_CASE_STUDIES while minimising
   INTRINSIC_COGNITIVE_LOADS . in short , there was a substantial and
   MEASURABLE_IMPROVEMENT in STUDENT_PERFORMANCE , STUDENT_RETENTION , and
   STUDENT_SATISFACTION . TEACHING suggestions are provided for practitioners

   especially in data and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS , should prepare STUDENTS for
   landing their DREAM_JOB and prepare them to excel in their desired roles and
   grow within the company . our approach is to assist our STUDENTS in ( i )
   their ACTIVE_PARTICIPATION in charting a course for their career and ( ii )
   becoming a COMPETITIVE_FORCE within the market based on KNOWLEDGE gained in
   the program . the applied BUSINESS_ANALYTICS program at BOSTON_UNIVERSITY
   METROPOLITAN_COLLEGE has created a COMPETITIVE_CURRICULUM that
   SHAPES_STUDENTS into leaders by assessing the MARKETPLACE_NEEDS ( a function
   of its environment ) and preparing our STUDENTS to become LIFELONG_LEARNERS
   , thereby creating their COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE . the MODEL we have created
   contains three KEY_AREAS , ( i ) the ACADEMIC_PROGRAM and the valuation of
   its quality through SKILL_DEVELOPMENT , ( ii ) the evaluation of the
   JOB_MARKET as a subset of the MACRO_ENVIRONMENT , ( iii ) the
